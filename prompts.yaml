- name: "Full JSON Extractor (DB Schema)"
  text: |
    Analyze the real estate listing text below. Your task is to extract all available information and structure it as a JSON object that matches the database schema.

    **Instructions:**
    1.  **Strict Extraction:** Fill in the JSON fields **only** with information explicitly found in the text.
    2.  **Do Not Invent Data:** For fields that are not mentioned in the text, use `null` as the value. Do not make up or infer data.
    3.  **Correct Data Types:** Ensure that numbers (like `price`, `total_area`) are represented as numbers, not strings. Text fields should be strings.
    4.  **Return Only JSON:** Your final output must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else.
